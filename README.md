# Qord
A high level library for building Discord bots.

**This library is currently in development.**

## Questions that you are having

- **What is this?**

  This is yet another library for Discord Bots API. This is not a finished project and is currently in it's development phase.

- **Why create another library?**

  After discord.py archive, I could not find a library that I could use to develop my bots in future so here we are. As it may sound, This
  is definitely not a personal project, See below.

- **Is this going to be a publicly available library?**

  Yes, It will be a public library but currently it is not finished and not in state of being released publicly. You can
  still install a very unstable version of this library (`pip install qord`) and hack it (Instructions in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/nerdguyahmad/qord/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD#usage) file).

- **Can I contribute?**

  That would be much appreciated! See [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/nerdguyahmad/qord/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.MD) for more information and to get yourself
  familiar with the project.

- **When will this be finished?**

  No idea yet; but soon:tm:

- **Documentation?**

  Yes. https://qord.readthedocs.io
